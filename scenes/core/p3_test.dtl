A group of scientists and detectives stand around the suspect; his head wired into a complex array of computers.
His body is motionless, eyes darting beneath closed lids as he unknowingly relives the crime.
Monitors flicker with reconstructed memories — his every move played back, analyzed, dissected.
The detectives watch in silence, piecing together the truth. Then, a breakthrough.
They finally see it. The moment he hid the body.
With a nod, one of the officers speaks. "We’ve got him."
The other one replies,
"Well, well, well. Just when you thought nothing could go wrong...
your mind has betrayed you...
